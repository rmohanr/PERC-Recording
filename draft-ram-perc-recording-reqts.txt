Requirements for recording in Privacy Based RTP conferencing environment
                draft-ram-dispatch-perc-recording-reqts

Abstract

   Session recording is a critical requirement in many business
   communications environments, such as call centers and financial
   trading floors.  In some of these environments, all calls must be
   recorded for regulatory and compliance reasons.  In others, calls may
   be recorded for quality control or business analytics.

   Recording is typically performed by sending a copy of the session
   media to the recording devices.  This document defines requirements
   for recording in Privacy Based RTP conferencing environment.

1.  Introduction

   Session recording is a critical operational requirement in many
   businesses, especially where voice is used as a medium for commerce
   and customer support.  A prime example where voice is used for trade
   is the financial industry.  The call recording requirements in this
   industry are quite stringent.  The recorded calls are used for
   dispute resolution and compliance.  Other businesses, such as
   customer support call centers, typically employ call recording for
   quality control or business analytics, with different requirements.

   While recording is critical operation in many businesses, respecting
   the privacy rights and wishes of users engaged in a call is of
   paramount importance.  In many jurisdictions, participants have a
   right to know that the session is being recorded or might be
   recorded, and they have a right to opt out, either by terminating the
   call or by demanding that the call not be recorded.  SIPREC work in
   IETF standardises Session Initiation Protocol(SIP) based protocol
   based recording where in the participants are notified of the
   recording and have the flexibility to opt out of recording.  SIPREC
   work describes mechanisms to record both secure and non-secure media.
   Among the different architectures SIPREC supports, conference
   recording is one of them.

   There is a trend in the industry for enterprises to use cloud
   services to host multi-party conferences and meet-me services, either
   exclusively or to meet peak loads on-demand.  The increased use of

   cloud services has exposed a problem.  There are two different trust
   domains from a media perspective: endpoints and other devices in a
   trusted domain, and conference servers controlled by the cloud
   service in an untrusted domain.
   [I-D.jones-avtcore-private-media-reqts] describes the requirements
   for ensuring the privacy and integrity of real-time media flows
   between two or more endpoints communicating in a switched
   conferencing environment.  The architecture suggested in
   [I-D.jones-avtcore-private-media-reqts] enables switching conference
   servers to be hosted in domains in which the network elements may
   have low trust by means of having dual-key model for media where in
   the media headers (like RTP/RTCP) is encrypted using one pair of keys
   and the media payload is encrypted using a different pair of keys.
   This document describes requirements for recording in such a
   architecture.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   All of the pertinent terminology and taxonomy used in this document
   is based on [I-D.jones-avtcore-private-media-reqts].

   In addition, this document uses the following terminology extending
   it from [RFC6341]:

      Session Recording Server (SRS): A Session Recording Server (SRS)
      is a SIP User Agent (UA) or webRTC endpoint
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] or a webRTC Gateway
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-gateways] that is a specialized media server or
      collector that acts as the sink of the recorded media.  An SRS is
      typically implemented as a multi-port device that is capable of
      receiving media from multiple sources simultaneously.  An SRS is
      the sink of the recorded session metadata.

      Session Recording Client (SRC): A Session Recording Client (SRC)
      is a SIP User Agent (UA) or webRTC endpoint
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-overview] or a webRTC Gateway
      [I-D.ietf-rtcweb-gateways] that acts as the source of the recorded
      media, sending it to the SRS.  An SRC is a logical function.  Its
      capabilities may be implemented across one or more physical
      devices.  The SRC provides metadata to the SRS.

      Communication Session (CS): A session created between two or more
      SIP User Agents (UAs) or webRTC endpoints or between webRTC
      endpoint and a webRTC Gateway that is the subject of recording.

Internet-Draft      Requirement for recording in PERC          July 2015


      Recording Session (RS): The session created between an SRC and SRS
      for the purpose of recording a Communication Session.  This could
      be a SIP Session or a webRTC session.

      Metadata: Information that describes recorded media and the CS to
      which they relate.

   In this use-case, a Privacy Enhanced RTP conference mixer is acting
   as SRC and recording media to a SRS.  The recording Session between
   SRC and SRS is setup and media is forking to SRS.  This model brings
   in requirements like authorizing PERC mixer(SRC) to fork the media,
   authorizing a SRS before it can get access to keys to playback the
   recording, getting consent from participants for recording, notifying
   participants of the recording.

   TBD DISCUSS: SIPREC defines a mechanism to notify SIP endpoints that
   the call is being recorded in section 7.3 of
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol] and this is done in the SIP dialog.
   However no such mechanism exist to notify recording for webRTC calls.
   Since webRTC endpoints use SDP, technically we could re-use the
   semantics defined in section 7.3 SIPREC protocol
   [I-D.ietf-siprec-protocol]  but the model for webRTC call recording
   needs to be described some where.  The same goes for other aspects of
   recording like indicating metadata, participant preference to record.

   TBD: Should the Recording Session between SRC and SRS be a SIP dialog
   (like SIPREC) only or can it be even a HTTP(webRTC) call or any other
   control channel ?

   One of the endpoint in the conference is acting as SRC and recording
   media to a SRS.  The endpoint could be SIP UA or WebRTC endpoint, a
   SIP B2BUA or a webRTC Gateway.  The recording Session between SRC and
   SRS is setup and media is forking to SRS.  This model brings in
   requirements like authorizing the endpoint in the conference to fork
   the media, authorizing a SRS before it can get access to keys to
   playback the recording, getting consent from participants for
   recording, notifying participants of the recording.

4.  Requirements for recording

   This section defines requirements for recording in a PERC
   environment.  It considers the use-cases mentioned in section 3 of
   this draft.

      REQ1: The mechanism MUST support the ability to have only
      authorized participants act as SRC and setup a Recording Session
      with SRS.

      REQ2: The mechanism MUST provide a way for metadata to be conveyed
      to the SRS incrementally in the Recording Session (if we are using
      SIP dialog in RS, this is already taken care by SIPREC protocol).

      REQ3: The mechanism MUST include a means for ensuring the
      confidentiality of the metadata sent from the SRC to the SRS.

      REQ4: The mechanism MUST provide a means of indicating to
      participants whether recording is taking place, for appropriate
      rendering at the user interface.

      REQ5: The mechanism MUST include a means for ensuring that the
      integrity and confidentiality of the media sent from the SRC to
      the SRS

      REQ6: The mechanism MUST provide a means to have a SRS authorize
      itself with the KMS and get the keys needed to play back the
      recording.

      REQ 7: The mechanism MUST provide a means to have participants in
      the conference indicate their recording preference.

5.  Security Considerations

   Session recording has substantial security implications, for the
   endpoints being recorded, the SRC, and the SRS.

   For the endpoints involved in the conference, the requirements in
   this document enable the endpoint to identify that a conference is
   being recorded and to request that a given conference not be subject
   to recording.

   With regard to security implications of the protocol(s), clearly
   there is a need for authentication, authorization, and eavesdropping
   protection for the solution.  The SRC needs to know the SRS it is
   communicating with is legitimate, and vice versa, even if they are in
   different domains.  Both the signaling and media for the Recording
   Session need the ability to be authenticated and protected from

   eavesdropping.  Also the SRC needs to be authorized to record the
   conversation.  SRS needs to authenticate itself with KMS before it
   can access the recordings.  All these Requirements are detailed in
   the section 4 of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document makes no request of IANA.
